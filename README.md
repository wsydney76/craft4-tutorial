# Craft 4 Solo - Tutorial

This tutorial/workshop started as a pure Craft CMS starter as provided in the craftcms/craft package with 
the following additions:

* Added modules/_faux to enable autocompletion for some most frequently used variables in twig
* Moves example module to modules/main
* Set system timezone to Europe/Berlin
* Added /web/cpresources, /node_modules, /config/license.key to .gitignore
* Added more config settings and use fluent syntax in config/general.php

We then built a extended version of Craft's official tutorial.

* Added sample content (mostly AI generated/translated)
* Added twig frontend templates with a lot of comments that should be helpful for beginners.
